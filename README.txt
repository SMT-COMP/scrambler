This is the official SMT-COMP benchmark scrambler for SMT-LIB scripts.

Its usage is as follows: 

Syntax: ./scrambler[options] < input_file.smt2
where options are:
  -terms_annot [true|false]
  -seed n (>= 0)
  -unfold PATTERN
  -unfold_start n
  -unfold_end n

-terms_annot true means that annotations associated to terms will be kept in
             the script, false means that they will be removed
-seed n is the random seed for scrambling. If not provided, the result of the
        time call is used. If the seed is 0, no scrambling is performed
-unfold PATTERN can be used to generate N individual benchmarks from an
                incremental one containing N (check-sat) commands. PATTERN in
                this case is a pattern for the output file names. For
                instance, with an input file containing 2 (check-sat)
                commands, -unfold OUT will generate OUT.1.smt2 and OUT.2.smt2
-unfold_start n and
-unfold_end n       can be used to unfold only a subrange of the indivdual
                    queries
